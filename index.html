            There are a lot of Ghibli Movies that I like.I really like Studio Ghibli movies because of their beautiful animation, heartwarming stories, and magical worlds. Films like Spirited Away,My Neighbor Totoro, and Howl's Moving Castle are my favorites. Each movie feels like a dreamy escape where nature, fantasy, and emotion come together in the most comforting way. But there are some soft type movies also like The tale of princess kaguya,From up on poppy hill. The characters are unique and inspiring, and the music always touches my heart. Ghibli movies are not just fun to watch—they make me feel calm, nostalgic, and hopeful every time.
